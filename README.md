# ASCII Art Generator
A tool for generating ASCII art based on the lightness/darkness of the pixels. Users are free to adjust the width, the ASCII characters, and the contrast of the final piece. The contrast of the final piece is determined by a contrast curve, which in reality is a quadratic function that amplifies contrast according to a few user-set parameters.

```
lighten or darken mode: the use of this parameter depends on your text editor. If your text editor is a dark-themed editor (like a terminal), use lighten mode. Otherwise, use darken mode. 

The following descriptions are written with the assumption that DARKEN mode is being used. The descriptions may be incorrect, depending on how you interpret them.

y=[(a/255)(x-h)^2 + k] / c
y: the change in the grayscale value
Contrast curve multiplier (a): A negative value separates gray-er values into light and dark. A positive value makes light or darker values even lighter or darker
Contrast amount (k): This is the height of the vertex of the quadratic equation. Increasing this number makes the change in contrast more extreme.
Contrast curve horizontal shift (h): A value less than 127.5 will make the final art piece darker. A value greater than 127.5 will make the final art piece lighter.
Contrast dampener (c): The contrast dampener factor reduces the effects of the contrast curve that is configured above. A factor of 1 changes nothing, any number greater than that will diminish the contrast change.
